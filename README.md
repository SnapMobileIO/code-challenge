# Full Stack Code Challenge

If you were a thriving youngster in the 90s, you’re familiar with the [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) toy that was all the craze. We’d like to do a throwback (although they are still available for purchase) to this amazing toy. Below are some user stories for what we’d like to see in our “codagotchi”. Make it your own, give it a name, and have fun with it. Definitely additional points for creativity. 

*As a user, I want to:*

* Create an account so that I can login anywhere to take care of my virtual pet
* Log in to my account so that I can view my pet
* Log out of my account so that I can keep my pet a secret
* View my virtual pet on my screen
* View multiple actions to perform on the pet like "feed", "pet", "sleep", and "clean up"
* Drag an action on top of my pet to perform that action
* See my pet "accept" the action by visually enlarging and shrinking
* Keep the pet alive by:
  * Feeding the pet three times a day
  * Petting the pet 5 times a day
  * Putting the pet to sleep at night
  * Waking the pet up in the morning
  * Cleaning up after the pet at least 2 times a day
* View a visual meter next to my pet letting me know how "happy" and "hungry" the pet is
* See my pet "not make it", if I don't perform the tasks to keep my pet alive
* Start a new virtual after my pet “doesn’t make it”

*Additional Requirements:*
* This can be in any front-end and back-end language (FYI we are a Javascript/Typescript shop–Node/Angular/React)
* There should be a back-end with an API that handles all of the actions for the pet and basic user creation and authentication
* The app doesn't need to be beautiful, but take the time to show off your html/css skills
* Choose any image of a "pet" you want (cat, dog, pizza, celebrity, etc.)
* Don't worry about over complicating the authentication for the app, but do make sure it's secure
* Make it your own and add any additional features you’d like (e.g., multiple virtual pet images that you get randomly, more actions to perform, etc.)

This shouldn’t take more than a few hours for the core features, but feel free to spend more time on it. When you're ready, send over your GitHub URL. If you've stumbled upon this and want to submit your app, send it to hello@snapmobile.io.
